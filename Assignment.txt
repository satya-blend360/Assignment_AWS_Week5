Deploy Sales ETL as a Serverless Function

Goal:

    Deploy the output of your ETL pipeline as a cloud-based analytics API.

Tasks:
    Use the ETL output stored in AWS S3 or Azure Blob Storage.

    Create an AWS Lambda or Azure Function that:
    
        Reads aggregated sales data.
        Runs KPI calculations (e.g., total revenue, top region).
        Returns results as JSON via API Gateway / Azure HTTP Trigger.
        Configure a scheduled trigger (e.g., CloudWatch/EventBridge).
        Log execution results to CloudWatch or Application Insights.

Tech: AWS Lambda / Azure Functions, Boto3 / Azure SDK

Deliverables: Deployed function link + code repo + screenshots (Lambda/Function console, API JSON response, logs)
